# OIDC project relying on Keycloak

This project demonstrate how to use keycloack from a Spring Boot Application (OIDC RP).

Keycloak will be used as an Identity Broker.
This is done using https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_client_suggested_idp.

In this sample, we forward to 'google' Identity Broker

## Setup

* copy src/main/docker folder content in your %USERPROFILE% directory
  docker toolbox can only read volumes from this directory by default.
* start docker-compose in src/main/docker
* start the application with DOCKER_HOST env var pointing to your docker ip
  you can get the docker ip by running `docker-machine env default`
* connect to http://localhost:8080, you'll be redirected to google to login


## Notes

* keycloak console is available at http://<docker-host>:8180/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/master
